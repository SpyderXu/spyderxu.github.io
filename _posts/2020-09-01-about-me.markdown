## 徐传智(ChuanzhiXu)

### Education Experience
* Automation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Huazhong University of Science and Techonology &nbsp; &nbsp; 2013-2017 &nbsp; Bachelor 
* Pattern Recognition & Intelligent Systems &nbsp; &nbsp; Shanghai Jiao Tong University &nbsp; &nbsp; 2017-2020 &nbsp; Master

I received my master degree in Automation Department of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I major in computer vision and interested in object detection, tracking and segmentation during that time.  

I have been an advertising algorithm engineer in ByteDance since 2020.05.

Here are some links about me during 2017-2020:

* [Github](https://github.com/SpyderXu) : Some source codes and paper list.
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/chuanzhixu) : Some object detection and segmentation challenges which I took part in.
* [Leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/u/spyderxu/) : Some algorithm problems I practice to improve my poor program skills.

Here are some skills about me during 2017-2020:

* Program Language : C/C++、 Python、 Matlab
* Deep Learning Framework : Caffe、 Pytorch
* CV Open Source Library : OpenCV、 OpenVino

Here are my familiar areas about CV during 2017-2020:

* Object detection : 2D object detection or Monocular 3D object detection.
* Tracking : Multi-object Tracking or Single-object Tracking.
* Trajectory prediciton.
* Traditional image processing and computer vision algorithms.
* Traditional pattern recognition algorithms.
* Instance segmentation and Pose estimation (just a little).
